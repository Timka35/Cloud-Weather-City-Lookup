Dear friends, mainly our project has two part. First is a scratch project, second part a python websocket client program which is runing on a server. This python program connects to scratch websocket and listening out scratch projects. When changing a cloud varable, scratch websocket send a message to our websocket client program. Than our python program get city weather condition information from https://openweathermap.org

You can open a free account than get a apikey which we use it to connect openweather api with python program.
